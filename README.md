## About

In this Project, I used cricket T20 world cup (2022) data to provide insights into the best 11-player lineup that could play for my team. I collected data from the espncricinfo website using Bright Data web scraping, transformed and cleaned the data in Pandas, and then created dashboards in Power BI.

## About dataset:

The Dataset is obtained from [T20 World cup](https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/tournament/team-match-results/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2022-23-14450). I used web scraping to gather data from the Bright Data website. I gathered four datasets from this website: batting summary, bowling summary, player information, and match results. The data I collected from Bright Data is in JSON (Java Script Object Notation) format.
here are the code that i used for webscrapping:
